## About conference

Thanks to my employer Overstock.com, I was able to attend Devoxx Poland 2018 conference. The conference took place in Krakow and lasted three days (20 - 22 June).

I found 50% of the talks I attended were very good, 25% were okay and 25% were poor. Overall, I also felt there were not enough advanced talks - and in general I felt the tone of the talks was 101.

I would definitely attend this confernce again!

To assist me present my experience and learnings back to my colleagues, I decided to digitaize my notes as a seies of posts.
