Event Architecture

Event Storming

lightweight technique

All we need is unlimited space on a wide wall, sticky notes and both business and technical people gathered in one room

Can derive your public API

Can derive your services / modules

Why

Loose coupling
OOP is a bad name – Message Oriented Programming better name
 
Demo
Used spock & TDD
Def
Given
When (and)
Then
The old way
this.limit = ?
At this point there are no orange notes in the code
Create an event object
ID (ccuuid)
Timestamp
“amount”
Contract is still the same
Use map for db
API.match
Save == easy
Load == tricky
 
Considerations
Backwards Compatibility
Learning curve
Different perspectives
 
Event Architecture
Channels
RabbitMQ
EJP
